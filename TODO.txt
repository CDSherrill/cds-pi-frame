o Need to correctly rotate the images... can do this ahead of time
using the jhead command (installable in linux).  This can be done one 
time to make the image match the exif orientation, and then strip the
exif orientation info (so more advanced programs don't attempt to apply
an additional rotation to an already-fixed image)
o Setting the image dimensions the same isn't working .... some images that 
are portrait instead of landscape, or that have odd dimensions, get stretched.
Instead, need to figure out which dimension needs to get scale, and then
scale uniformly.  Either we preprocess images (could do, since we make
a list of them anyway...) or we process them on the fly and display in a
canvas or something.
